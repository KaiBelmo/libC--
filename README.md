## libC--
i recode C++ containers with some additional data structures in C just for educational purposes.

***note*** *each container folder has it's own readme file, it contains the documentation and some example about how to use the container.*


Sequence containers:
 - [x] forward_list
 - [x] list
 - [x] vector
 - [x] deque
 
Associative containers:
 - [ ] set
 - [ ] map
 - [ ] multiset
 - [ ] multimap
 
Unordered associative containers:
 - [ ] unordered_set
 - [ ] unordered_map
 - [ ] unordered_multiset
 - [ ] unordered_multimap

Container adaptors:
 - [x] queue
 - [x] stack
 - [x] priority_queue
